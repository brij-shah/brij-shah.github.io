            <div style= "color: #45A29E">A local program that constructs a tree made of asteriks in the terminal. Requires user input for the width of the trunk and the overall and height of the tree. Program also requires the starting width of the leaves of the tree. This allows the user to customize their own tree. The program was originally created for a school assignment, but I continued to work on it to make it more user-friendly, efficient, and unique. The program was implemented using the fundamentals of C++, such as basic if-else statements, nested if-else statements, basic for loops, basic while loops, nested for loops, and variables.

            <div style= "color: #45A29E">A public program based on a webpage that allows the user to actively implement their imagination and creativity. Program uses canvases and strokes to help the user visualize what they are drawing. The dots are drawn in timed intervals, so based on the speed of mouse motion, the strokes are different thickness. User can also draw 3-dimensional shapes. Program states the exact coordinate of the cursor, so figures that are drawn can be as accurate as can be. Some bugs still exist, but I am constantly updating the code to make it better and more user friendly. You can interact with the webpage and program
